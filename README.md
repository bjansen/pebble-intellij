## Installation

This plugin is available in JetBrains' [plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/9407-pebble),
from your IDE go to `Preferences > Plugins` and enter `pebble` in the search bar.

## Mixing Pebble and other languages

To make the editor recognize two languages in the same file, for example HTML 
and Pebble, go to `Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Template Data Languages`
and select the `HTML` data language on the directory that contains your Pebble
templates:

This will enable features like syntax highlighting, code completion, navigation,
Emmet expansions etc.

## Using code completion

In order to use code completion, you will have to let the plugin know what the type
of `foo` is. This can be done using `@pebvariable` hints, much like in the JSP, FreeMarker
and Velocity plugins:

`@pebvariable` hints can be easily added to templates via the `var` live template. They must
follow this syntax:

    {# @pebvariable name="<name>" type="<type>" #}

For code completion to work properly in the `type` attribute, your `.peb` files need to be placed
under a [content root](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/content-roots.html) (e.g. `src/main/resources`).
Otherwise, classes defined in your own source files won't be suggested.
